## Logging Practices

### What to Log

**Always Log**:
- Authentication events (login, logout, token validation)
- Request metadata (method, path, status code, duration)
- User context (user_id, tenant_id, request_id)
- Error conditions (with error codes)
- Data access events (which user accessed which resource)
- Configuration changes
- Security events (permission denials, suspicious activity)

**Example**:
```python
logger.info(
    "Document accessed",
    extra={
        "user_id": user_id,
        "tenant_id": tenant_id,
        "document_id": document_id,
        "action": "read",
    }
)
```

---

### What NOT to Log

**Never Log**:
- Authorization tokens or headers (`Authorization: Bearer token`)
- Passwords or credentials
- Protected Health Information (PHI)
  - Patient names
  - Social Security Numbers
  - Medical record numbers
  - Diagnosis information
  - Treatment details
- Query parameters containing PHI
- Request/response bodies containing PHI
- Full exception stack traces to external systems

**BAD Example**:
```python
# BAD - Logs PHI
logger.info(f"User accessed patient {patient_name}, SSN: {ssn}")

# BAD - Logs authorization token
logger.info(f"Request headers: {request.headers}")
```

**GOOD Example**:
```python
# GOOD - Logs only reference IDs
logger.info(
    "Patient record accessed",
    extra={
        "user_id": user_id,
        "patient_id": patient_id,  # Reference ID only
        "action": "read",
    }
)
```

---

### Log Sanitization

**Redact Sensitive Data**:

```python
def sanitize_headers(headers: dict) -> dict:
    """Remove sensitive headers from logs."""
    sanitized = headers.copy()
    sensitive_headers = ["authorization", "cookie", "x-api-key"]

    for header in sensitive_headers:
        if header in sanitized:
            sanitized[header] = "***REDACTED***"

    return sanitized


def sanitize_query_params(params: dict) -> dict:
    """Remove PHI from query parameters."""
    sanitized = params.copy()
    phi_params = ["patient_id", "ssn", "mrn"]

    for param in phi_params:
        if param in sanitized:
            sanitized[param] = "***"

    return sanitized
```
