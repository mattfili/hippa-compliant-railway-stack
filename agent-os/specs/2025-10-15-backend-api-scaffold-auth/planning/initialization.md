# Initial Spec Idea

## User's Initial Description

Feature 1: Backend API Scaffold with Authentication

**Description from roadmap.md:**
- Set up FastAPI (Python) or Next.js (TypeScript) project structure
- Configure Railway deployment (railway.json, Dockerfile)
- Implement JWT-based authentication with OIDC/SAML integration
- Create tenant context middleware (extracts tenant_id from auth token)
- Set up environment variable management for AWS credentials, DB connection
- Basic health check and status endpoints
- CORS configuration
- Logging framework setup
- Effort: M (1-2 weeks)

**Context:**
This is the foundation feature for a HIPAA-compliant Railway template with RAG support. The product documentation is in `agent-os/product/` (mission.md, roadmap.md, tech-stack.md).

**Tech Stack (from tech-stack.md):**
- Backend: FastAPI (Python) preferred, or Next.js (TypeScript)
- Auth: JWT with OIDC/SAML, MFA via IdP (Okta/Auth0/Azure AD/Cognito)
- Deployment: Railway with Docker
- Encryption: TLS 1.2+, environment-based secrets
