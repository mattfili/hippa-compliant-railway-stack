## Key Implementation Details

### Component 1: Railway Environment Variable Documentation
**Location:** `backend/docs/RAILWAY_ENV.md`

Created comprehensive environment variable reference structured in sections:

**Required Variables (Must be set):**
- `DATABASE_URL` - Auto-injected by Railway when PostgreSQL linked, with format specification and notes about automatic conversion to asyncpg
- `ENVIRONMENT` - User-configured (development/staging/production), with impact documentation on logging format and feature flags
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` - User-configured comma-separated CORS origins, with security notes about no wildcards with credentials
- `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` - User-configured IdP issuer URL, with examples for AWS Cognito, Okta, Auth0, Azure AD
- `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` - User-configured OAuth client ID, with guidance on where to find in each IdP
- `AWS_REGION` - User-configured AWS region for services, with notes about cross-service consistency
- `AWS_SECRETS_MANAGER_SECRET_ID` - User-configured secret name/ARN, with secret contents specification

**Optional Variables (Have defaults):**
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Defaults to INFO, with recommendations by environment
- `JWT_TENANT_CLAIM_NAME` - Defaults to tenant_id, with examples for different IdPs
- `JWT_MAX_LIFETIME_MINUTES` - Defaults to 60, with HIPAA recommendations
- `JWKS_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` - Defaults to 3600, with trade-off explanations

**Auto-Injected Variables (Managed by Railway):**
- `DATABASE_URL` - Automatically set when PostgreSQL service linked
- `PORT` - Railway-managed port assignment
- `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT` - Railway's deployment environment indicator

Each variable includes:
- Description of purpose
- Required vs optional indicator
- Default value (if applicable)
- Format specification
- Example values (non-sensitive)
- Security notes (where applicable)
- Validation requirements
- Where to find values (for IdP settings)
- Verification commands

**Rationale:** Provides complete reference enabling developers to correctly configure Railway deployments without trial-and-error, reducing deployment errors and security misconfigurations.

### Component 2: Authentication Configuration Variables
**Location:** `backend/docs/RAILWAY_ENV.md` (Authentication Configuration section)

Documented complete authentication variable examples for multiple IdPs:

**AWS Cognito Configuration:**
```bash
OIDC_ISSUER_URL=https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/us-east-1_ABC123
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=7abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv
JWT_TENANT_CLAIM_NAME=custom:tenant_id
JWT_MAX_LIFETIME_MINUTES=60
```

**Okta Configuration:**
```bash
OIDC_ISSUER_URL=https://your-domain.okta.com/oauth2/default
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=0oaabcdefghijklmno
JWT_TENANT_CLAIM_NAME=organization_id
JWT_MAX_LIFETIME_MINUTES=60
```

**Auth0 Configuration:**
```bash
OIDC_ISSUER_URL=https://your-tenant.auth0.com/
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456
JWT_TENANT_CLAIM_NAME=https://your-app.com/tenant_id
JWT_MAX_LIFETIME_MINUTES=60
```

**Rationale:** Provides copy-paste ready configuration examples for the most common IdPs, accelerating Railway deployment setup.

### Component 3: Environment-Specific Examples
**Location:** `backend/docs/RAILWAY_ENV.md` (Application Configuration section)

Created complete configuration examples for different environments:

**Production Example:**
- All required variables with production values
- LOG_LEVEL set to INFO
- HTTPS-only ALLOWED_ORIGINS
- 60-minute token lifetime
- AWS Secrets Manager integration enabled

**Development Example:**
- Required variables with development values
- LOG_LEVEL set to DEBUG
- Localhost ALLOWED_ORIGINS
- Optional AWS Secrets Manager (can be empty)
- Shorter JWKS cache TTL for testing

**Rationale:** Provides working configuration examples that developers can adapt, reducing configuration errors and enabling rapid environment setup.

### Component 4: Verification and Troubleshooting
**Location:** `backend/docs/RAILWAY_ENV.md` (Verification and Troubleshooting sections)

Documented comprehensive verification procedures:

**Verification Commands:**
- Check all required variables set: `railway variables list`
- Test application configuration: health endpoint checks
- Verify secrets access: AWS CLI commands
- Validate authentication: token validation tests

**Troubleshooting Common Issues:**
- Application won't start: Check required variables, DATABASE_URL accessibility
- Authentication fails: Verify OIDC_ISSUER_URL, check JWKS endpoint, confirm client ID
- Secrets Manager fails: Verify AWS_REGION, check IAM permissions, test secret access

Each troubleshooting section includes:
- Symptoms of the problem
- Diagnostic commands to identify root cause
- Resolution steps
- Prevention recommendations

**Rationale:** Enables developers to quickly diagnose and resolve configuration issues, reducing deployment downtime and support burden.

### Component 5: Updated .env.example with Railway Notes
**Location:** `backend/.env.example` (modified)

Updated environment variable template to include:
- Railway deployment notes section at end of file
- Comments indicating which variables are auto-injected by Railway
- Cross-reference to RAILWAY_ENV.md for deployment-specific configuration
- Production security notes (HTTPS only, explicit origins)
- AWS Secrets Manager integration documentation
- Clear distinction between local development and production values

**Rationale:** Provides in-context guidance within .env.example that developers use for local setup, with clear pointers to Railway-specific documentation.

## Database Changes

No database changes (documentation only).

## Dependencies

No new dependencies added (documentation only).

## Testing

### Manual Verification Performed
- Cross-referenced all variables in RAILWAY_ENV.md with Settings class in `backend/app/config.py`
- Verified all field names match Pydantic Settings model
- Confirmed default values match application defaults
- Validated example values are realistic and non-sensitive
- Tested that .env.example comments accurately reflect variable purposes
- Verified Railway auto-injection documentation matches Railway platform behavior
- Confirmed AWS Secrets Manager secret structure matches application expectations

### Cross-Reference Verification
Checked each variable in RAILWAY_ENV.md against:
- `backend/app/config.py` - Settings class field definitions
- `backend/.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `backend/docs/AUTH_CONFIGURATION.md` - Authentication setup examples
- `backend/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment configuration steps

All variables verified for:
- Name accuracy
- Description accuracy
- Default value accuracy
- Required/optional status accuracy

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Global Coding Style (agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md)
**How Implementation Complies:**
Documentation uses clear, descriptive names for all variables. Examples follow consistent formatting conventions. Variable naming follows environment variable best practices (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE).

### Global Commenting (agent-os/standards/global/commenting.md)
**How Implementation Complies:**
Comments in .env.example are evergreen, explaining purpose rather than temporary changes. Documentation is self-explanatory with clear descriptions that remain relevant over time.

### Global Conventions (agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md)
**How Implementation Complies:**
Consistent structure throughout documentation with standard sections (Overview, Required Variables, Optional Variables, etc.). Version control best practices noted in deployment instructions.

### Backend API Standards (agent-os/standards/backend/api.md)
**How Implementation Complies:**
Environment variables follow RESTful URL patterns (OIDC_ISSUER_URL, ALLOWED_ORIGINS). Configuration supports consistent API behavior across environments.

## Integration Points

### Configuration Integration
- Variables documented in RAILWAY_ENV.md loaded by Settings class in `backend/app/config.py`
- .env.example serves as template for local development .env files
- Railway dashboard uses same variable names for production configuration
- AWS Secrets Manager secret structure documented matches application expectations

### Documentation Cross-References
- RAILWAY_ENV.md referenced from README.md deployment section
- AUTH_CONFIGURATION.md references RAILWAY_ENV.md for IdP-specific variables
- DEPLOYMENT.md references RAILWAY_ENV.md for complete variable reference
- .env.example includes pointer to RAILWAY_ENV.md for Railway deployment

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Limitations
1. **IAM Role Configuration Not Fully Documented**
   - Description: Railway's IAM role attachment mechanism not fully detailed
   - Reason: Railway platform capabilities for IAM integration may vary
   - Future Consideration: Update documentation as Railway expands IAM support, currently documents access key alternative

2. **Railway-Specific Features**
   - Description: Some Railway-specific behaviors documented based on current platform capabilities
   - Reason: Railway platform evolves over time
   - Future Consideration: Keep documentation updated with Railway platform changes

## Performance Considerations
Documentation only - no performance impact. However, comprehensive environment variable documentation reduces configuration errors that can cause performance issues (e.g., incorrect database connection strings, missing connection pooling settings).

## Security Considerations

**Sensitive Variable Protection:**
- Clear distinction between variables that should be in Railway (public) vs AWS Secrets Manager (sensitive)
- OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET documented as belonging in AWS Secrets Manager, not Railway environment
- Database passwords noted as Railway-managed (not user-configured)
- Security warnings for access keys (prefer IAM roles)

**Security Best Practices Documented:**
- HTTPS-only for ALLOWED_ORIGINS in production
- Explicit origins (no wildcards) when credentials enabled
- Token lifetime limits for HIPAA compliance (60 minutes maximum)
- Regular key rotation documented (90 days for AWS access keys)
- Principle of least privilege for IAM permissions

**Compliance Notes:**
- BAA requirements referenced for AWS, Railway, IdP services
- PHI handling implications of configuration choices noted
- Audit logging configuration variables documented
