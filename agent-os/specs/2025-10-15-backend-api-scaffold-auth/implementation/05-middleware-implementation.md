# Task 5: Middleware Implementation

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #5 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-15-backend-api-scaffold-auth/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Status:** âœ… Complete

### Task Description
Implement middleware layer for tenant context management, request/response logging with HIPAA-compliant sanitization, exception handling with standardized error responses, and structured JSON logging configuration. This provides request tracking, audit trails, and consistent error handling across all API endpoints.

## Implementation Summary
Implemented a comprehensive middleware layer with four main components: structured JSON logging with context variables, tenant context middleware for multi-tenant isolation, logging middleware with request tracking and sanitization, and integration into the FastAPI application. The existing exception handling middleware (from Task Group 8) was already in place. The middleware chain establishes request context, tracks all requests with unique IDs, sanitizes sensitive data from logs (HIPAA compliance), and provides structured JSON output for log aggregation.

The architecture uses context variables (ContextVar) for request-scoped logging context, middleware chaining for proper execution order, and integration with FastAPI's lifespan events for logging setup.

## Key Implementation Details

### Structured JSON Logging
**Location:** `/Users/mattfili/Dev/hippa-compliant-railway-stack/backend/app/utils/logger.py`

Implemented structured JSON logging system with:
- `JSONFormatter` class that outputs logs in JSON format with timestamp, level, logger, message, request_id, user_id, tenant_id, context
- Context variables (ContextVar) for request-scoped logging context (request_id, user_id, tenant_id)
- `LogContext` context manager for setting/resetting logging context
- `setup_logging()` function that configures root logger with JSON or simple formatting based on environment
- Helper functions for logging with additional context (debug_with_context, info_with_context, etc.)

The JSONFormatter adds exception info with type, message, and traceback for ERROR/CRITICAL logs, and includes source location (file, line, function) for these levels.

**Rationale:** Structured JSON logs enable log aggregation and querying in CloudWatch/ELK. Context variables provide request-scoped context without passing through function parameters. JSON format is machine-parseable for automated analysis. Source location helps debugging production issues.

### Tenant Context Middleware
**Location:** `/Users/mattfili/Dev/hippa-compliant-railway-stack/backend/app/middleware/tenant_context.py`

Implemented tenant context extraction middleware with:
- Extraction of tenant_id from request.state.user_context (set by authentication dependency)
- Injection of tenant_id into logging context via context variable
- Exclusion of public paths (/, /docs, /openapi.json, /api/v1/health/*, /api/v1/auth/callback)
- Proper context reset after request completion

The middleware runs after authentication (when UserContext is available) and before route handlers, ensuring tenant_id is available in all logs within the request lifecycle.

**Rationale:** Centralized tenant context management ensures consistent tenant logging. Middleware approach is non-invasive - route handlers don't need to extract tenant_id manually. Context variable reset prevents context leakage between requests.

### Logging Middleware with HIPAA Sanitization
**Location:** `/Users/mattfili/Dev/hippa-compliant-railway-stack/backend/app/middleware/logging.py`

Implemented request/response logging middleware with:
- UUID4 generation for unique request_id
- Request start logging (DEBUG) with method, path, sanitized query params, client host
- Request completion logging (INFO) with status code, duration in milliseconds, user_id
- Request failure logging (ERROR) with exception details
- Sensitive data sanitization for query parameters (SSN, phone, email patterns)
- X-Request-ID header injection in responses for client correlation

The middleware sanitizes query parameters using:
- Predefined sensitive parameter name list (patient_id, ssn, mrn, dob, phone, email, address)
- Heuristic detection for PHI patterns (SSN format, phone numbers, emails)
- Redaction to "***" for sensitive values

**Rationale:** Unique request_id enables request tracking across distributed systems. Duration tracking helps identify slow requests. HIPAA sanitization prevents PHI leakage in logs. Client correlation via X-Request-ID header helps debugging. Heuristic detection catches PHI even when parameter names aren't on list.

### Middleware Registration and Logging Setup
**Location:** `/Users/mattfili/Dev/hippa-compliant-railway-stack/backend/app/main.py`

Updated application factory with:
- Lifespan context manager for startup/shutdown events
- Logging setup during startup with JSON format in production, simple format in development
- Middleware registration in correct execution order:
  1. ExceptionHandlerMiddleware (outermost - catches all errors)
  2. LoggingMiddleware (logs requests/responses)
  3. CORSMiddleware (handles CORS headers)
  4. TenantContextMiddleware (extracts tenant context)
  5. Route handlers (innermost)

The lifespan manager calls `setup_logging()` with environment-based configuration before the application starts handling requests.

**Rationale:** Lifespan manager ensures logging is configured before first request. Middleware order ensures: exceptions caught globally, all requests logged, CORS headers added, tenant context available to routes. JSON logging in production enables log aggregation; simple format in development improves readability.

## Database Changes
No database changes in this task.

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies Added
All dependencies already specified in pyproject.toml. Uses standard library modules:
- `json` - JSON serialization for log formatting
- `logging` - Python logging framework
- `contextvars` - Request-scoped context variables
- `uuid` - Request ID generation
- `time` - Request duration tracking
- `re` - Pattern matching for PHI detection

### Configuration Changes
Uses configuration from Task Group 3:
- ENVIRONMENT - Determines JSON vs simple log format
- LOG_LEVEL - Configures logging verbosity

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
None - verification testing deferred to Task Group 14 (strategic testing).

### Test Coverage
Manual verification performed:
- Logging middleware generates unique request_id for each request
- Request start/completion logged with appropriate level (DEBUG/INFO)
- Structured JSON logging outputs valid JSON with all expected fields
- Request duration calculated accurately
- X-Request-ID header added to responses
- Sensitive query parameters redacted (tested with ?ssn=123-45-6789, ?email=test@example.com)
- Tenant context middleware extracts tenant_id from user_context
- Tenant_id appears in logs for authenticated requests
- Exception middleware (Task Group 8) properly catches and logs errors
- Middleware execution order correct (verified via log sequence)

### Manual Testing Performed
1. Started application and verified logging configuration
2. Made test requests to / endpoint and verified logs in console
3. Tested authenticated requests to verify tenant_id in logs
4. Tested requests with sensitive query parameters (?ssn=123-45-6789)
5. Verified sensitive values redacted in logs
6. Triggered error and verified exception logging with stack trace
7. Confirmed X-Request-ID header in response
8. Tested both JSON and simple log formats by changing ENVIRONMENT

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### /agent-os/standards/backend/api.md
**How Implementation Complies:**
- Consistent request/response handling: All requests logged with same structure
- Request tracking: Unique request_id enables distributed tracing
- Standard HTTP headers: X-Request-ID follows common convention

**Deviations:** None

### /agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md
**How Implementation Complies:**
- Meaningful names: JSONFormatter, LogContext, LoggingMiddleware clearly describe purpose
- Small, focused functions: Each middleware method handles one aspect (start logging, completion logging, error logging)
- Consistent naming: snake_case for functions, PascalCase for classes
- No dead code: All code is actively used
- DRY principle: Sanitization logic centralized, context management reused

**Deviations:** None

### /agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md
**How Implementation Complies:**
- User-friendly messages: Error responses don't expose sensitive data
- Centralized error handling: Exception middleware handles all errors at application boundary
- Graceful degradation: Logging middleware continues even if logging fails (try/except in formatters)
- Clean up resources: Context variables properly reset after request

**Deviations:** None

### /agent-os/standards/global/validation.md
**How Implementation Complies:**
- Sanitize input: Query parameters sanitized before logging to prevent PHI leakage
- Allowlists: Sensitive parameter names defined in allowlist
- Consistent validation: Sanitization applied to all requests uniformly

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points

### APIs/Endpoints
- Middleware applies to all API endpoints automatically
- Logging middleware logs all HTTP requests
- Tenant context middleware extracts context for authenticated endpoints
- Exception middleware catches errors from all endpoints

### External Services
None - middleware is internal infrastructure

### Internal Dependencies
- Uses Settings from Task Group 3 for configuration (ENVIRONMENT, LOG_LEVEL)
- Uses UserContext from Task Group 4 authentication dependencies
- Integrates with exception handling from Task Group 8
- Will be used by all future API endpoints for request tracking and error handling

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified.

### Limitations
1. **PHI Detection Heuristics**
   - Description: PHI detection uses pattern matching which may have false positives/negatives
   - Reason: Perfect PHI detection requires semantic understanding, pattern matching is practical compromise
   - Future Consideration: Could use ML-based PII detection for more accurate classification

2. **In-Memory Context Variables**
   - Description: Context variables are stored in memory per request, no persistence
   - Reason: Request-scoped context doesn't need persistence
   - Future Consideration: Not a limitation - design choice for performance

3. **Single Request ID Format**
   - Description: Uses UUID4 format only, not compatible with distributed tracing formats (W3C Trace Context)
   - Reason: UUID4 is simple and sufficient for request correlation
   - Future Consideration: Could add support for W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing integration

## Performance Considerations
- Request ID generation (UUID4) is very fast (~1 microsecond)
- Context variables have minimal overhead (thread-local storage)
- JSON serialization adds ~100 microseconds per log entry (negligible)
- Middleware execution order optimized: logging outer, tenant context inner (less overhead for public endpoints)
- Query parameter sanitization uses efficient dict comprehension and regex compilation

## Security Considerations
- HIPAA-compliant logging: PHI redacted from logs (no SSN, phone, email in logs)
- Sensitive parameter names allowlist prevents accidental PHI logging
- Heuristic PHI detection catches patterns even with unknown parameter names
- No Authorization headers logged (handled by middleware)
- Stack traces only in logs, never in client responses (handled by exception middleware)
- Request IDs are random UUIDs - no information leakage

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
- Task Group 6 (Authentication Endpoints): Authentication endpoints benefit from request logging
- Task Group 7 (Health Check Endpoints): Health checks logged like all other endpoints
- All future API endpoints: Automatically get request logging, error handling, and tenant context
- Future audit logging (Task Group 12 HIPAA docs): Request logging provides foundation for audit trail

## Notes
- The middleware execution order is critical: ExceptionHandler must be outermost to catch all errors, LoggingMiddleware must be before TenantContext to log tenant context extraction failures.
- Context variables (ContextVar) are the correct way to handle request-scoped state in async Python. They work correctly with asyncio and concurrent requests.
- The JSON log format is compatible with CloudWatch Logs Insights, Elasticsearch, and other log aggregation tools. Queries can filter by request_id, user_id, tenant_id, etc.
- HIPAA compliance note: The sanitization logic is defensive - it errs on the side of redacting too much rather than too little. Better to redact a non-PHI value than to leak PHI.
- The logging middleware calculates duration in milliseconds (not seconds) because API response times are typically measured in milliseconds for REST APIs.
- The simple (non-JSON) log format in development makes local debugging easier. The JSON format in production enables automated log analysis.
- The exception middleware integration means that even unhandled exceptions are logged with full context (request_id, tenant_id, user_id) for debugging.
