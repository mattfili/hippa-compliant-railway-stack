# Task 12: HIPAA Compliance Documentation

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #12 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-15-backend-api-scaffold-auth/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Create comprehensive HIPAA Security Rule compliance checklist documenting implemented features, future requirements, audit event types for future implementation, and HIPAA logging practices (what to log, what NOT to log).

## Implementation Summary

Created HIPAA_READINESS.md as a comprehensive compliance checklist mapping all application features to specific HIPAA Security Rule requirements. The document clearly distinguishes between implemented features, partially implemented features, and future requirements, enabling compliance officers to quickly assess readiness. Documented audit event types with complete JSON schemas for future implementation and provided extensive logging guidelines that protect PHI while enabling compliance audits.

## Key Implementation Details

### Component 1: HIPAA Security Rule Compliance Checklist
**Location:** `backend/docs/HIPAA_READINESS.md` (Access Control section)

Documented comprehensive compliance checklist for all HIPAA Security Rule requirements:
- **Access Control (§164.312(a))**: Unique user identification (✅ implemented via JWT), emergency access (future), automatic logoff (partial - token expiration implemented, session timeout future), encryption (future), RBAC (future)
- **Audit Controls (§164.312(b))**: Request ID tracing (✅ implemented), user context logging (✅ implemented), immutable audit logs (future), retention policies (future)
- **Integrity (§164.312(c))**: Transmission security (✅ implemented via TLS 1.2+), data integrity validation (future)
- **Person/Entity Authentication (§164.312(d))**: JWT authentication (✅ implemented), MFA (✅ implemented at IdP level), token expiration (✅ implemented)
- **Transmission Security (§164.312(e))**: TLS encryption (✅ implemented), VPC segmentation (future)

Each requirement includes:
- Current implementation status with checkboxes [x] for implemented, [~] for partial, [ ] for future
- Description of what's implemented
- Evidence (file references and verification commands)
- Future implementation plans with feature references

**Rationale:** Provides compliance officers and developers with immediate visibility into HIPAA readiness, identifying gaps and required future work.

### Component 2: Audit Event Types for Future Implementation
**Location:** `backend/docs/HIPAA_READINESS.md` (Audit Event Types section)

Documented complete audit event specifications for future Feature 10 implementation:

**Authentication Events:**
- AUTH_LOGIN_SUCCESS, AUTH_LOGIN_FAILED, AUTH_LOGOUT with required fields (user_id, tenant_id, ip_address, timestamp, outcome)
- AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED, AUTH_PERMISSION_DENIED with context about denial reason

**Data Access Events:**
- DATA_ACCESS for PHI viewing with resource_type, resource_id, action fields
- DATA_MODIFIED for PHI changes with operation type and fields_changed

All events include:
- Event type identifier
- Required field schema in JSON format
- Description of when event should be triggered
- Example JSON structure

**Rationale:** Provides concrete specifications that developers can implement in Feature 10, ensuring consistent audit trail structure and enabling future compliance audits.

### Component 3: HIPAA Logging Practices
**Location:** `backend/docs/HIPAA_READINESS.md` (Logging Practices section)

Created comprehensive logging guidelines:

**What to Log:**
- Authentication events (login, logout, token validation)
- Request metadata (method, path, status_code, duration)
- User context (user_id, tenant_id, request_id) - reference IDs only
- Data access events (which user accessed which resource by ID)
- Error conditions with sanitized messages
- Security events (permission denials, suspicious activity)

**What NOT to Log:**
- Authorization tokens or headers
- Passwords or credentials
- Protected Health Information (PHI):
  - Patient names, SSNs, medical record numbers
  - Diagnosis information, treatment details
- Query parameters containing sensitive data
- Request/response bodies containing PHI
- Full exception stack traces to external systems

**Log Sanitization Examples:**
- Code examples showing BAD practices (logging PHI, tokens)
- Code examples showing GOOD practices (logging reference IDs only)
- Sanitization functions for headers and query parameters

**Rationale:** Prevents PHI exposure in logs while maintaining compliance audit trail, directly addressing the critical HIPAA requirement that logs must not contain PHI.

### Component 4: Business Associate Agreements (BAA)
**Location:** `backend/docs/HIPAA_READINESS.md` (BAA section)

Documented all required Business Associate Agreements:
- **AWS Services**: RDS, S3, KMS, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch, Bedrock - with verification commands
- **Railway**: Application hosting platform - with contact information for obtaining BAA
- **Identity Provider**: AWS Cognito, Okta, Auth0, Azure AD - with provider-specific BAA notes

For each service:
- List of services requiring BAA
- Verification steps to confirm BAA coverage
- Contact information for obtaining BAAs

**Rationale:** Ensures compliance officers can quickly verify all required BAAs are in place before handling PHI, satisfying HIPAA's business associate requirements.

### Component 5: Compliance Artifacts Checklist
**Location:** `backend/docs/HIPAA_READINESS.md` (Compliance Artifacts section)

Documented all required compliance documentation:
- **Security Policies**: Access control policy, data encryption policy, incident response plan, disaster recovery plan, audit log retention policy
- **Risk Assessment**: Security risk assessment report, vulnerability assessment, penetration testing results, risk mitigation plans
- **Training Records**: HIPAA training completion, secure coding training, incident response training
- **Audit Logs**: 6-year retention requirement, audit trail exports
- **BAAs**: All service provider agreements
- **Incident Response**: Data breach notification procedures, incident reporting templates, post-incident review

**Rationale:** Provides compliance checklist for all required HIPAA documentation, enabling systematic compliance verification.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Global Coding Style (agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md)
**How Implementation Complies:**
All code examples in documentation use clear, descriptive naming. Examples demonstrate best practices for logging (what to log vs what NOT to log) with concrete code snippets that developers can adapt.

### Global Commenting (agent-os/standards/global/commenting.md)
**How Implementation Complies:**
Documentation is evergreen with no temporal references. Examples are self-documenting with clear explanations of why certain patterns are HIPAA-compliant vs non-compliant.

### Global Error Handling (agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md)
**How Implementation Complies:**
Logging practices section documents user-friendly error messages without exposing technical details or PHI, aligning with error handling best practices.

### Backend API Standards (agent-os/standards/backend/api.md)
**How Implementation Complies:**
Audit event specifications follow consistent API patterns with clear field definitions, JSON schemas, and outcome indicators (success/failure).

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Limitations
1. **Future Features Documented but Not Implemented**
   - Description: Audit event types, immutable audit logs, automatic session timeout, RBAC, and emergency access are documented but marked as future implementation
   - Reason: Foundational scaffold does not yet include these features (planned for Features 10, 13, 19)
   - Future Consideration: Update implementation status as features are completed

2. **Compliance Verification Tools Not Provided**
   - Description: Checklist requires manual verification of compliance status
   - Reason: Automated compliance scanning tools are out of scope for documentation task
   - Future Consideration: Add automated compliance check scripts in future feature

## Performance Considerations
Documentation only - no performance impact. However, comprehensive HIPAA documentation accelerates compliance audits and reduces risk of violations, saving significant time and potential penalties.

## Security Considerations

**Critical Security Documentation:**
- Logging practices explicitly prohibit logging PHI, preventing HIPAA violations
- BAA requirements documented to ensure compliant service provider selection
- TLS 1.2+ enforcement documented for transmission security
- Token expiration limits documented (60 minutes maximum for PHI access)
- MFA enforcement documented at IdP level
- Audit event specifications enable complete security audit trail

**Compliance Impact:**
- Prevents PHI exposure through improper logging practices
- Ensures all service providers have required BAAs
- Documents security controls required for HIPAA compliance
- Enables compliance officers to quickly assess readiness for audits
