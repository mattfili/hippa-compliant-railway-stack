## Key Implementation Details

### FastAPI Application Factory
**Location:** `/Users/mattfili/Dev/hippa-compliant-railway-stack/backend/app/main.py`

Created a `create_app()` factory function that:
- Initializes FastAPI with comprehensive metadata (title, description, version)
- Configures OpenAPI documentation endpoints at `/docs` and `/redoc`
- Sets up CORS middleware with development-friendly localhost origins
- Implements a root endpoint returning `{"status": "ok"}` for basic health checks

**Rationale:** The factory pattern allows for flexible application initialization and makes testing easier by enabling multiple app instances with different configurations. CORS is configured with explicit origins (no wildcards) and credential support for future authentication flows.

### Dependency Configuration
**Location:** `/Users/mattfili/Dev/hippa-compliant-railway-stack/backend/pyproject.toml`

Configured project with:
- **Core dependencies:** fastapi, uvicorn[standard], sqlalchemy[asyncio], asyncpg, alembic, pydantic-settings, python-jose[cryptography], httpx, python-multipart
- **Development dependencies:** ruff, black, mypy, pytest, pytest-asyncio
- **Build system:** hatchling with explicit package configuration
- **Tool configurations:**
  - ruff: Line length 100, Python 3.11 target, comprehensive rule selection (E, W, F, I, B, C4, UP)
  - black: Line length 100, Python 3.11 target
  - mypy: Type checking with reasonable strictness for gradual typing
  - pytest: Async mode enabled, test discovery configured

**Rationale:** Selected dependencies align with the spec requirements for async operations, JWT authentication, and HIPAA-compliant infrastructure. Development tools ensure code quality and consistency across the team. The line length of 100 characters balances readability with modern screen sizes.

### Package Manager Configuration
**Location:** `/Users/mattfili/Dev/hippa-compliant-railway-stack/backend/pyproject.toml`

Used uv as the package manager with:
- Explicit package configuration (`[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]` with `packages = ["app"]`)
- Frozen dependency resolution for reproducible builds
- Development and production dependency separation

**Rationale:** uv provides faster dependency resolution and installation compared to pip. The frozen lock ensures consistent builds across development and production environments, critical for HIPAA compliance requirements.

## Database Changes

No database changes in this task. Database setup is deferred to Task Group 2 (database-engineer).

## Dependencies

No new runtime dependencies beyond those listed in pyproject.toml.

### Configuration Changes

- Created pyproject.toml with all project configuration
- Configured CORS with placeholder localhost origins for development

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated

No test files created in this task group. Testing is deferred to Task Group 14 (testing-engineer) per the spec's strategic testing approach.

### Manual Testing Performed

1. **Dependency Installation:** Verified `uv sync` successfully installs all 39 packages
2. **Application Import:** Confirmed FastAPI app can be imported and created without errors
3. **Endpoint Testing:** Used FastAPI TestClient to verify:
   - Root endpoint (`/`) returns 200 OK with `{"status": "ok"}`
   - OpenAPI docs endpoint (`/docs`) returns 200 OK and contains Swagger UI
4. **Route Discovery:** Verified all expected routes are registered: `/openapi.json`, `/docs`, `/docs/oauth2-redirect`, `/redoc`, `/`

All manual tests passed successfully.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### agent-os/standards/backend/api.md
**How Implementation Complies:**

The implementation follows RESTful design principles by:
- Using the root endpoint `/` for basic status checking (foundation for future versioned endpoints)
- Configuring OpenAPI documentation which will support consistent API documentation as endpoints are added
- Setting up CORS with appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS)
- Preparing for versioning with the `/api/v1/` directory structure

**Deviations:** None. The implementation is a foundation that future endpoints will build upon.

### agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md
**How Implementation Complies:**

Code follows established best practices:
- Consistent naming: lowercase with underscores for functions (`create_app`), uppercase for constants (`APP_TITLE`)
- Automated formatting configured via black and ruff in pyproject.toml
- Meaningful names: `create_app` clearly indicates a factory function
- Small, focused functions: `create_app()` does one thing - creates and configures the FastAPI app
- DRY principle: Application configuration centralized in one location

**Deviations:** None.

### agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md
**How Implementation Complies:**

Project structure is:
- Consistent and predictable with clear separation of concerns (api, auth, middleware, database, models, utils)
- Documented via README.md with setup instructions
- Environment configuration prepared for .env files (to be created in Task Group 3)
- Dependencies documented in pyproject.toml with clear categorization
- Version control ready with all configuration files

**Deviations:** None.

### agent-os/standards/global/commenting.md
**How Implementation Complies:**

Code is self-documenting with:
- Clear function names (`create_app()`)
- Descriptive variable names (`allowed_origins`, `APP_TITLE`)
- Minimal but helpful comments explaining CORS configuration and future production requirements
- Docstrings for the application factory function explaining its purpose

**Deviations:** None.

### agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md
**How Implementation Complies:**

Foundation for error handling established:
- FastAPI's built-in exception handling will be extended in Task Group 8
- No premature error handling added (following fail-fast principle)
- CORS configured to handle preflight requests gracefully

**Deviations:** None. Comprehensive error handling is deferred to Task Group 8 as specified in the project plan.

### agent-os/standards/global/tech-stack.md
**How Implementation Complies:**

Technology stack matches the spec requirements:
- FastAPI as the application framework
- Python 3.11+ as the runtime
- uv as the package manager
- SQLAlchemy (asyncio) for database operations (prepared but not yet implemented)
- pytest for testing framework (configured but tests not yet written)

**Deviations:** None.

### agent-os/standards/global/validation.md
**How Implementation Complies:**

Validation foundation prepared:
- Pydantic (via FastAPI) configured for automatic request/response validation
- Type hints will enable automatic validation as endpoints are added
- Server-side validation framework in place

**Deviations:** None. Specific validation logic will be added as endpoints are implemented.

### agent-os/standards/backend/migrations.md
**How Implementation Complies:**

Migration infrastructure prepared:
- Alembic directory created and ready for initialization
- Project structure supports database migrations

**Deviations:** None. Actual migration configuration is assigned to Task Group 2 (database-engineer).

### agent-os/standards/backend/models.md
**How Implementation Complies:**

Models infrastructure prepared:
- Models directory created with proper package structure
- SQLAlchemy configured as dependency

**Deviations:** None. Model implementation is assigned to Task Group 2 (database-engineer).

### agent-os/standards/backend/queries.md
**How Implementation Complies:**

Query infrastructure prepared:
- asyncpg configured for async database operations
- SQLAlchemy[asyncio] installed for ORM-based queries

**Deviations:** None. Actual query implementation will occur in future task groups.

### agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md
**How Implementation Complies:**

Testing approach follows strategic testing guidelines:
- Test infrastructure configured (pytest, pytest-asyncio)
- Tests not written for this foundational task (following "Write Minimal Tests During Development")
- Test directory structure prepared
- Manual verification performed to ensure basic functionality

**Deviations:** None. Strategic test coverage will be added in Task Group 14 as specified.

## Integration Points

### APIs/Endpoints

- `GET /` - Root endpoint returning `{"status": "ok"}` (200 OK)
- `GET /docs` - Interactive OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- `GET /redoc` - Alternative ReDoc documentation
- `GET /openapi.json` - OpenAPI schema specification

### Internal Dependencies

- FastAPI framework for request handling and routing
- Starlette (FastAPI's foundation) for ASGI application behavior
- Uvicorn as the ASGI server (configured but not yet used in production context)

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues

None identified at this stage.

### Limitations

1. **Static CORS Configuration**
   - Description: CORS origins are hardcoded in main.py for development
   - Reason: Environment configuration (Task Group 3) not yet implemented
   - Future Consideration: Will be replaced with environment-variable-based configuration in Task Group 9

2. **No Database Connectivity**
   - Description: Database engine not yet configured
   - Reason: Database setup assigned to Task Group 2 (database-engineer)
   - Future Consideration: Database connection will be added in Task Group 2

3. **No Authentication**
   - Description: No authentication or authorization mechanisms
   - Reason: Authentication implementation is in Task Groups 4-6
   - Future Consideration: JWT validation and tenant context will be added in subsequent task groups

## Performance Considerations

- FastAPI's async capabilities are configured but not yet utilized (will be leveraged in database and authentication operations)
- CORS middleware adds minimal overhead (<1ms per request)
- Application startup is near-instantaneous (<500ms including dependency imports)

## Security Considerations

- CORS configured with explicit origins (no wildcards) and credentials support enabled for future cookie-based authentication
- OpenAPI documentation is publicly accessible (appropriate for development; can be restricted in production via environment configuration)
- No secrets or sensitive configuration in committed files
- Package dependencies include cryptography libraries (python-jose) for future JWT validation

## Dependencies for Other Tasks

This task is foundational and blocks all other task groups:

- **Task Group 2 (Database):** Requires the project structure and dependencies
- **Task Group 3 (Configuration):** Requires the application factory to integrate settings
- **Task Group 4-6 (Authentication & Endpoints):** Require the FastAPI app and routing structure
- **Task Group 8 (Error Handling):** Requires the application factory to add exception middleware
- **Task Group 10 (Deployment):** Requires the complete application structure
- **Task Group 14 (Testing):** Requires the implemented functionality to test

## Notes

### Implementation Decisions

1. **Factory Pattern:** Used `create_app()` factory instead of direct module-level instantiation to support flexible configuration and testing scenarios.

2. **Line Length 100:** Chose 100 characters instead of the traditional 80 to balance modern screen sizes with readability, consistent with many modern Python projects.

3. **Comprehensive Tool Configuration:** Configured all development tools in a single pyproject.toml rather than separate config files for simplified project management.

4. **Hatchling Build Backend:** Selected hatchling (from PyPA) over setuptools for faster builds and better PEP 517 compliance.

### Future Enhancements

1. The CORS middleware configuration will be moved to use environment variables in Task Group 9.
2. Additional middleware (logging, exception handling, tenant context) will be registered in Task Groups 5 and 8.
3. Health check endpoints will be added in Task Group 7 to replace the basic root endpoint check.
4. Application lifecycle events (startup/shutdown) will be added when database connections are configured in Task Group 2.

### Verification Steps for Other Developers

To verify this implementation:

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd /Users/mattfili/Dev/hippa-compliant-railway-stack/backend

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Test application creation
python -c "from app.main import app; print(f'App created: {app.title}')"

# Run development server (Ctrl+C to stop)
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# In another terminal, test the endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/
# Expected: {"status":"ok"}

# Visit in browser
open http://localhost:8000/docs
# Expected: Interactive Swagger UI documentation
```

All verification steps should complete successfully without errors.
