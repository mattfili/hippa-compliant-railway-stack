# Task 8: Error Registry & Response Format

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #8 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-15-backend-api-scaffold-auth/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Create a comprehensive error registry with standardized error codes, custom exception classes, and a centralized error response formatter to ensure consistent error handling across the API with HIPAA-compliant error messages that never expose sensitive information or stack traces to clients.

## Implementation Summary

I implemented a comprehensive error handling system that provides standardized error responses across the entire API. The solution includes an error code registry using Python Enums for type safety, custom exception classes that map to specific HTTP status codes, and a centralized error response formatter. The exception handling middleware catches all errors (both custom and unexpected), logs them with full stack traces for debugging, but returns safe, standardized error responses to clients that never expose internal details or PHI.

The implementation follows HIPAA compliance requirements by ensuring error messages are user-friendly without exposing technical details, and technical debugging information is only logged server-side. The error response format includes request IDs for correlation between client errors and server logs, making it easy to debug issues while maintaining security.

## Key Implementation Details

### Error Code Registry (backend/app/utils/errors.py)

**Location:** `backend/app/utils/errors.py`

I created a centralized error code registry using Python Enums to provide type-safe error codes. The registry includes three categories:
- **AUTH_xxx** (001-999): Authentication and authorization errors
- **SYS_xxx** (001-999): System and infrastructure errors
- **VAL_xxx** (001-999): Validation errors

Each error code has a corresponding description in the `ERROR_DESCRIPTIONS` dictionary and maps to an appropriate HTTP status code in the `ERROR_STATUS_CODES` dictionary. This approach ensures consistency and makes it easy to add new error codes in the future.

**Rationale:** Using Enums provides type safety and autocomplete support in IDEs. The centralized registry ensures error codes are never duplicated and makes it easy to reference them throughout the codebase. Separating descriptions and status codes into dictionaries allows for easy maintenance and lookup.

### Custom Exception Classes (backend/app/utils/errors.py)

**Location:** `backend/app/utils/errors.py`

I implemented a base `APIException` class that all custom exceptions inherit from. This class stores the error code, user-friendly message, technical detail, and HTTP status code. I also created specific exception classes for different error categories:
- `AuthenticationError` - For 401 Unauthorized errors
- `AuthorizationError` - For 403 Forbidden errors
- `ValidationError` - For 400 Bad Request errors
- `SystemError` - For 500/503 system errors

Each exception class includes a `to_dict()` method that converts the exception to a dictionary suitable for JSON responses, with an option to include or exclude technical details based on the environment.

**Rationale:** Having specific exception classes makes it easier for developers to raise the appropriate error type, and the inheritance structure ensures consistency. The `to_dict()` method provides a clean way to convert exceptions to API responses without exposing implementation details.

### Error Response Formatter (backend/app/utils/errors.py)

**Location:** `backend/app/utils/errors.py`

The `format_error_response()` function creates standardized error responses in the format:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "AUTH_001",
    "message": "Invalid authentication token",
    "detail": "Token signature verification failed",  // Only in development
    "request_id": "req-123-abc-456"
  }
}
```

The function accepts an `include_detail` parameter that controls whether technical details are included in the response. This is set to True in development and False in production to ensure sensitive information is never exposed to end users.

**Rationale:** Standardizing the error response format makes it easier for frontend clients to handle errors consistently. Including request IDs allows for easy correlation between client errors and server logs. The conditional detail inclusion ensures we provide helpful debugging information in development while maintaining security in production.

### Exception Handling Middleware (backend/app/middleware/exception.py)

**Location:** `backend/app/middleware/exception.py`

I created a middleware class `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` that sits at the top of the middleware stack and catches all exceptions. The middleware handles two types of exceptions:

1. **Custom APIException instances**: These are logged with their error code and returned to the client with the defined error format.
2. **Unexpected exceptions**: These are logged with full stack traces but return a generic "Internal server error" to the client with error code SYS_003.

The middleware checks the environment (development vs production) to determine whether to include technical details in error responses. In production, only generic error messages are returned, while in development, additional technical details are included to aid debugging.

**Rationale:** Placing exception handling in middleware ensures all routes are protected without requiring try-catch blocks in every handler. Logging full stack traces server-side while returning safe error messages to clients follows HIPAA compliance requirements. The environment-based detail inclusion provides a good balance between developer experience and production security.

## Database Changes

No database changes were required for this task.

## Dependencies

No new dependencies were added. The implementation uses only standard Python libraries and existing project dependencies (FastAPI, Starlette).

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `backend/test_error_handling.py` - Comprehensive test script for error registry and exception classes
- `backend/test_cors_config.py` - Test script for CORS configuration

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ✅ Complete
- Integration tests: ⚠️ Partial (manual testing via FastAPI startup)
- Edge cases covered:
  - Error codes defined correctly
  - APIException and specific exception classes work properly
  - Error response formatter handles all cases (with/without detail, with/without request_id)
  - Middleware catches both custom and unexpected exceptions
  - Environment-based detail inclusion works correctly

### Manual Testing Performed
1. Ran test script: `python test_error_handling.py` - All tests passed
2. Verified FastAPI application starts with middleware: `python -c "from app.main import app; print('✓ App created successfully')"` - Success
3. Checked middleware count to ensure exception middleware is registered: Confirmed 2 middleware (exception + CORS)
4. Verified that the middleware is first in the chain (executes before CORS)

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Error Handling Standards (agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md)
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
My implementation follows all error handling best practices from the standards file:
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Error messages are clear and actionable without exposing technical details in production
- **Fail Fast and Explicitly**: The error registry ensures errors are raised with specific codes and messages
- **Specific Exception Types**: Created specific exception classes (AuthenticationError, ValidationError, etc.) rather than generic exceptions
- **Centralized Error Handling**: Implemented middleware that handles all exceptions at the API boundary
- **Graceful Degradation**: The system continues to function and returns proper error responses even for unexpected exceptions
- **Clean Up Resources**: Exception middleware ensures proper logging and response formatting regardless of error type

**Deviations (if any):** None. The implementation fully complies with all error handling standards.

### API Standards (agent-os/standards/backend/api.md)
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/backend/api.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The error response format follows RESTful API conventions:
- **HTTP Status Codes**: Each error code maps to an appropriate HTTP status code (401, 403, 400, 500, 503)
- **Consistent Naming**: Error response structure is consistent across all error types
- **RESTful Design**: Error responses use standard HTTP status codes to indicate the type of error

**Deviations (if any):** None.

### Conventions (agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md)
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
- **Consistent Project Structure**: Error handling files are organized logically in `app/utils/` and `app/middleware/`
- **Clear Documentation**: All functions and classes include comprehensive docstrings
- **Environment Configuration**: Error detail inclusion is controlled via ENVIRONMENT variable, never hardcoded

**Deviations (if any):** None.

## Integration Points

### APIs/Endpoints
The exception middleware integrates with all API endpoints automatically. It sits at the top of the middleware stack and catches exceptions from any route handler, other middleware, or dependencies.

### Internal Dependencies
- Integrates with `app.main.py` via middleware registration
- Used by all future route handlers (they can raise APIException or specific exception subclasses)
- Error codes will be used by authentication, validation, and other components

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None currently identified.

### Limitations
1. **Request ID Support**
   - Description: The error response formatter accepts a `request_id` parameter but this is not yet implemented in the middleware (will be added in Task Group 5: Logging Middleware)
   - Impact: Error responses currently do not include request IDs for log correlation
   - Future Consideration: Will be addressed when logging middleware is implemented

## Performance Considerations

The error handling implementation has minimal performance overhead:
- Error code lookups are O(1) dictionary operations
- Exception handling only occurs on error paths (not hot paths)
- No blocking I/O or expensive operations in error handling

## Security Considerations

This implementation follows HIPAA compliance requirements:
- Technical details and stack traces are never exposed to clients in production
- Error messages are generic and do not leak information about system internals
- Request IDs will allow log correlation without exposing sensitive information
- Environment-based detail inclusion ensures development convenience without production security risks

## Dependencies for Other Tasks

This task provides the foundation for error handling throughout the application:
- Task Group 4 (Authentication): Will use AuthenticationError and AuthorizationError
- Task Group 5 (Middleware): Will integrate request_id into error responses
- Task Group 6-7 (API Endpoints): Will use error codes and custom exceptions
- All future features will use the error registry for consistent error handling

## Notes

The error handling implementation is production-ready and follows industry best practices for API error handling. The use of Enums for error codes provides type safety, and the centralized error registry makes it easy to add new error codes as the application grows. The exception middleware ensures consistent error responses across all endpoints without requiring error handling code in individual route handlers.

The implementation is designed to be extensible - new error codes can be added to the ErrorCode enum, and new exception classes can be created by inheriting from APIException. The error response format is simple and well-documented, making it easy for frontend developers to integrate with the API.
