- DRY principle: Middleware patterns designed for reusability (spec.md lines 183-188)

VERIFIED: Spec aligns with coding style standards

### Test Writing Compliance
**Status:** PASSED

The spec strictly follows test-writing.md standards:
- "Write Minimal Tests During Development": Task Group 14 writes ONLY 20-26 strategic tests
- "Test Only Core User Flows": Tests focus exclusively on authentication, health checks, middleware (critical paths)
- "Defer Edge Case Testing": Task 14.7 explicitly states "Do NOT aim for comprehensive coverage - focus on critical paths only"
- "Test Behavior, Not Implementation": Test descriptions focus on outcomes (e.g., "Test JWT signature verification with valid token")
- "Mock External Dependencies": Task 14.6 creates fixtures for mock JWT, database, JWKS
- "Fast Execution": No full application stack required (line 794)

VERIFIED: Test approach fully compliant with user standards

## Critical Issues
**Status:** NONE

No critical issues found. The specification accurately reflects all user requirements and follows all user standards.

## Minor Issues
**Status:** NONE

No minor issues found. The specification is comprehensive and well-structured.

## Over-Engineering Concerns
**Status:** NONE

The specification appropriately scopes the feature:
- No unnecessary features added beyond user requirements
- Test coverage focused and limited (20-26 tests, not comprehensive)
- All custom components justified by domain requirements
