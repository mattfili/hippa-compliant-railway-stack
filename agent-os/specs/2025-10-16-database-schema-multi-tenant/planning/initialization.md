# Initial Spec Idea

## User's Initial Description
Feature 2: Database Schema and Multi-Tenant Data Model.

**Feature Description from Roadmap:**
PostgreSQL schema with tenant isolation patterns, pgvector extension setup, core tables (tenants, users, documents, audit_logs), foreign key relationships, and database migrations framework. Includes indexes optimized for tenant-scoped queries.

**Context:**
This is Feature 2 from the product roadmap. Feature 1 (Backend API Scaffold with Authentication) has been completed and provides:
- ✅ FastAPI application structure
- ✅ Database engine with async SQLAlchemy + Alembic
- ✅ pgvector extension enabled (initial migration exists)
- ✅ Tenant context middleware
- ✅ Authentication with JWT validation

Feature 2 builds on this foundation to create the actual database schema with:
- Core tables: tenants, users, documents, audit_logs
- Multi-tenant data isolation patterns
- Foreign key relationships
- Optimized indexes for tenant-scoped queries
- Database migrations for all tables

**Tech Stack (from Feature 1):**
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- Async SQLAlchemy 2.0
- Alembic migrations
- UUID primary keys
- Automatic timestamps

**Dependencies:**
- Feature 1 complete ✅
- Database engine and base models already exist
- Alembic framework already configured
