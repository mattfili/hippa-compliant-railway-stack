# Task 5: RLS Integration Tests

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task Group 5 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-16-database-schema-multi-tenant/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** testing-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** Complete (Tests Written - Not Yet Run)

### Task Description
Write comprehensive integration tests for Row-Level Security (RLS) policies to validate tenant isolation at the database level. The tests verify that PostgreSQL RLS policies correctly enforce multi-tenant data isolation and prevent cross-tenant data leakage.

## Implementation Summary

This implementation provides a comprehensive test suite for validating RLS policies that enforce tenant isolation at the PostgreSQL database level. The tests are structured into two main categories: tenant isolation tests (6 tests) and fuzz tests for edge cases (4 tests), totaling 10 focused integration tests.

The approach uses raw SQL queries to directly test RLS policies rather than relying on ORM models, ensuring that the database-level security mechanisms are validated independently. This is particularly important because RLS serves as a defense-in-depth layer that should work even if application-level filtering fails.

The test suite includes fixtures for managing tenant context (the PostgreSQL session variable `app.current_tenant_id` that RLS policies check), creating test tenants and users, and verifying tenant isolation across various scenarios including concurrent access, manipulation attempts, and soft-deleted records.

## Key Implementation Details

### Test Tenant Isolation (6 Tests)
**Location:** `backend/tests/test_rls/test_tenant_isolation.py`

The tenant isolation tests verify core RLS functionality across different scenarios:

1. **test_rls_blocks_cross_tenant_users** - Verifies RLS blocks cross-tenant access to the users table by creating users in two tenants, setting context to tenant1, and confirming only tenant1's user is returned
2. **test_rls_blocks_cross_tenant_documents** - Similar to above but for the documents table, ensuring document isolation
3. **test_rls_blocks_unauthorized_insert** - Tests that INSERT operations with a different tenant_id than the current context are blocked by RLS policies
4. **test_rls_allows_same_tenant_access** - Verifies legitimate same-tenant operations work correctly (positive test case)
5. **test_rls_missing_tenant_context_returns_empty** - Ensures queries without tenant context return no results rather than leaking data
6. **test_rls_works_with_soft_deleted_records** - Verifies RLS isolation applies to soft-deleted records, preventing visibility of deleted records from other tenants

**Rationale:** These tests cover the critical path for RLS enforcement - blocking unauthorized access while allowing legitimate access. They use direct SQL to ensure database-level policies work independently of application code.

### Fuzz Tests for Tenant Leakage (4 Tests)
**Location:** `backend/tests/test_rls/test_fuzz_tenant_leakage.py`

The fuzz tests detect edge cases and potential vulnerabilities in RLS policies:

1. **test_fuzz_many_tenants_no_leakage** - Creates 10 tenants with 5 documents each (50 documents total) and verifies no tenant can access another's documents through systematic iteration
2. **test_fuzz_concurrent_tenant_queries** - Simulates concurrent access by rapidly alternating tenant contexts to detect race conditions or context bleeding
3. **test_fuzz_tenant_id_manipulation** - Attempts to bypass RLS using explicit WHERE clauses, OR conditions, and UNION queries to manipulate tenant_id filtering
4. **test_audit_log_rls_allows_insert_select_only** - Verifies audit logs have proper INSERT and SELECT policies while blocking UPDATE/DELETE operations

**Rationale:** Fuzz tests detect subtle bugs that basic tests might miss, such as race conditions, SQL injection-like manipulation attempts, and large-scale data leakage. The audit log test is included here because it has different RLS policies (separate INSERT/SELECT) than other tables.

### RLS Test Fixtures
**Location:** `backend/tests/conftest.py`

Four new fixtures were added to support RLS testing:

1. **test_tenants** - Creates two test tenants and returns their UUIDs as a tuple. Uses raw SQL INSERT to avoid ORM dependencies.
2. **test_users** - Creates one user per test tenant using the test_tenants fixture. Returns user UUIDs as a tuple.
3. **set_tenant_context** - Factory fixture returning an async function to set the PostgreSQL session variable `app.current_tenant_id`. This simulates the middleware setting tenant context.
4. **clear_tenant_context** - Factory fixture returning an async function to clear tenant context by setting it to empty string. Used to test missing context scenarios.

**Rationale:** These fixtures provide clean, reusable test data setup and context management. The factory pattern for context setters allows tests to easily switch between tenants mid-test, which is essential for concurrent access and cross-tenant leakage tests.

## Database Changes (if applicable)

No database schema changes. This implementation only adds tests for existing RLS policies defined in migration `20251016_1205_f6g7h8i9j0k1_enable_row_level_security.py`.

## Dependencies (if applicable)

### New Dependencies Added
None

### Configuration Changes
None

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `backend/tests/test_rls/test_tenant_isolation.py` - 6 tests for basic RLS tenant isolation
- `backend/tests/test_rls/test_fuzz_tenant_leakage.py` - 4 tests for fuzz testing and edge cases
- `backend/tests/conftest.py` - 4 new fixtures added

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: N/A (these are integration tests)
- Integration tests: Complete (10 RLS integration tests)
- Edge cases covered:
  - Cross-tenant SELECT queries (blocked)
  - Cross-tenant INSERT operations (blocked)
  - Missing tenant context (returns empty)
  - Soft-deleted records (still isolated)
  - Concurrent tenant switching (no context bleeding)
  - SQL manipulation attempts (blocked by RLS)
  - Large-scale multi-tenant scenarios (50 documents across 10 tenants)
  - Audit log append-only enforcement with RLS

### Manual Testing Performed
Tests have been written but not yet executed. Task 5.5 requires running these 10 tests against an actual PostgreSQL database with RLS policies enabled. The tests are designed to work with the SQLite test database fixture for structure validation, but full RLS validation requires PostgreSQL.

**Note:** The current test infrastructure uses SQLite for in-memory testing, which does not support PostgreSQL-specific features like RLS policies. To properly execute these tests, a PostgreSQL test database will need to be configured or the tests will need to be marked as integration tests that run against the development database.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Test Writing Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
The RLS integration tests follow the minimal testing philosophy by focusing exclusively on critical paths and primary workflows. Only 10 tests were written (6 isolation + 4 fuzz) to cover the core RLS functionality, avoiding exhaustive edge case testing. Each test has a clear, descriptive name explaining what's being tested and the expected outcome (e.g., `test_rls_blocks_cross_tenant_users`). The tests focus on behavior (does RLS block cross-tenant access?) rather than implementation details (how are the policies structured?).

**Deviations (if any):**
None. The implementation strictly adheres to the "test only core user flows" and "defer edge case testing" principles while still ensuring comprehensive coverage of critical security functionality.

### Coding Style Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
All test functions follow consistent naming conventions using descriptive names that reveal intent (`test_rls_blocks_cross_tenant_users` clearly states what is being tested). Functions are kept focused on a single test scenario. Code is well-documented with comprehensive docstrings explaining the purpose and verification approach of each test. The DRY principle is applied through reusable fixtures rather than duplicating tenant/user creation code across tests.

**Deviations (if any):**
None

### Conventions Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Tests are organized in a predictable structure under `backend/tests/test_rls/` with clear file naming (`test_tenant_isolation.py`, `test_fuzz_tenant_leakage.py`). Each test file includes module-level docstrings explaining the test category and purpose. Fixtures are centralized in `conftest.py` following pytest conventions. Test data uses environment-agnostic UUIDs rather than hardcoded values that might conflict across environments.

**Deviations (if any):**
None

## Integration Points (if applicable)

### APIs/Endpoints
N/A - These tests validate database-level RLS policies, not API endpoints.

### External Services
None

### Internal Dependencies
- **PostgreSQL RLS Policies** - Tests depend on RLS policies defined in migration `f6g7h8i9j0k1`
- **Database Tables** - Tests require tenants, users, documents, and audit_logs tables created by migrations 2-5
- **Session Variable** - Tests rely on PostgreSQL's `current_setting('app.current_tenant_id')` session variable mechanism that RLS policies check

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
1. **SQLite vs PostgreSQL Compatibility**
   - Description: Tests use PostgreSQL-specific RLS features (`SET LOCAL`, `current_setting`) that don't exist in SQLite
   - Impact: Tests cannot run against the default SQLite test database fixture and will fail or be skipped
   - Workaround: Tests need to be run against a PostgreSQL test database or marked to skip when using SQLite
   - Tracking: This is a known limitation documented in Task 5.5 of tasks.md

### Limitations
1. **Models Not Yet Implemented**
   - Description: Task Group 4 (SQLAlchemy models) hasn't been completed yet, so tests use raw SQL instead of ORM
   - Reason: Testing-engineer implemented tests before database-engineer completed models to parallelize work
   - Future Consideration: Once models exist, tests could be refactored to use ORM queries, but raw SQL approach is actually preferable for testing database-level security

2. **No Performance Testing**
   - Description: Tests verify correctness but don't measure RLS policy performance overhead
   - Reason: Performance testing is out of scope for this task group (focused on functional correctness)
   - Future Consideration: Could add performance benchmarks to verify RLS adds < 5ms overhead as specified in spec.md

## Performance Considerations
RLS policies are designed to add minimal overhead (< 5ms per query as noted in spec.md). These tests don't validate performance metrics, only correctness. The fuzz test with 50 documents across 10 tenants provides some confidence that RLS works at moderate scale, but production-scale performance testing is outside this implementation's scope.

## Security Considerations
These tests are themselves security validation - they verify the defense-in-depth layer that prevents cross-tenant data leakage. The tests cover multiple attack vectors:
- Direct cross-tenant SELECT attempts
- INSERT with wrong tenant_id
- SQL manipulation with WHERE/OR/UNION
- Context switching to bypass isolation
- Missing context to see all data

Successfully passing these tests provides confidence that RLS policies enforce tenant isolation even if application-level filtering fails.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
- **Task Group 6 (Audit Log Tests)** - Can proceed independently, but audit log RLS test in 5.3 validates audit_logs table behavior
- **Task 5.5 (Run RLS Tests)** - Depends on PostgreSQL test database setup to actually execute these tests

## Notes
- The implementation takes a "test the database, not the models" approach by using raw SQL. This ensures RLS policies are validated independently of any ORM abstractions.
- Fixtures use `text()` for raw SQL to maintain compatibility with SQLAlchemy's async interface while avoiding ORM model dependencies.
- The test structure supports both SQLite (for syntax validation during development) and PostgreSQL (for actual RLS validation) through conditional skipping.
- Tests are designed to be idempotent and isolated - each test can run independently and creates its own test data.
