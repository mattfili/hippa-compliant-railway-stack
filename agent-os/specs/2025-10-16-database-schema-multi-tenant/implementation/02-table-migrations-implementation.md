# Task 2: Table Migrations (Migrations 2-5)

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task Group 2 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-16-database-schema-multi-tenant/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** database-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** Complete

### Task Description
Create four Alembic migrations for the core database tables (tenants, users, documents, audit_logs) with comprehensive indexes, foreign key constraints, soft delete support, and immutability enforcement for audit logs.

## Implementation Summary
I successfully created four Alembic database migrations that establish the foundation for the multi-tenant HIPAA-compliant data model. Each migration follows a focused, reversible pattern with comprehensive table/column comments and appropriate indexing strategies.

Migration 2 creates the tenants table with soft delete support and seeds the system tenant required for administrative operations. Migration 3 creates the users table with a partial unique index that enables email reuse after soft deletion. Migration 4 creates the documents table with pgvector support for 1024-dimensional embeddings and JSONB metadata fields. Migration 5 creates the audit_logs table with database-level immutability enforcement using PostgreSQL triggers.

All migrations include proper downgrade() functions for reversibility and follow the naming convention established by Alembic (YYYYMMDD_HHMM_<revision>_<description>.py).

## Key Implementation Details

### Migration 2: Tenants Table
**Location:** `/Users/mattfili/Dev/hippa-compliant-railway-stack/backend/alembic/versions/20251016_1204_dd4cd840bc88_create_tenants_table.py`

Created the tenants table as the foundation for multi-tenancy with the following key features:
- UUID primary key with gen_random_uuid() default
- Soft delete support via deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ column
- Status column (VARCHAR(50)) for tenant lifecycle management (active, suspended, trial)
- kms_key_arn column (VARCHAR(512)) for future per-tenant encryption (Feature 4)
- TIMESTAMPTZ columns for created_at and updated_at with NOW() defaults
- Partial indexes: idx_tenants_status (WHERE deleted_at IS NULL) and idx_tenants_deleted_at (WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL)
- System tenant seed data with UUID '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
- Comprehensive table and column comments for documentation

**Rationale:** The tenants table is the root of the multi-tenant hierarchy. The partial indexes optimize queries for active tenants while maintaining the ability to query deleted tenants. The system tenant provides a consistent identifier for administrative and background operations. Using TIMESTAMPTZ throughout ensures HIPAA-compliant timestamp storage with timezone awareness.

### Migration 3: Users Table
**Location:** `/Users/mattfili/Dev/hippa-compliant-railway-stack/backend/alembic/versions/20251016_1204_37efbbdd6e44_create_users_table.py`

Created the users table with tenant association and unique email constraints:
- Foreign key to tenants(id) with ON DELETE RESTRICT to prevent cascading deletes
- Partial unique index idx_users_tenant_email_active ON (tenant_id, email) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
- external_idp_id column for integration with OIDC providers (Cognito, Auth0, etc.)
- role column (VARCHAR(50)) for future RBAC implementation (Feature 13)
- last_login_at TIMESTAMPTZ for tracking user activity
- Composite index idx_users_tenant_created for efficient tenant-scoped user listings
- Partial index idx_users_external_idp for OIDC provider lookups on active users only

**Rationale:** The partial unique index is critical for supporting soft deletes while preventing duplicate active emails within a tenant. ON DELETE RESTRICT ensures explicit handling of tenant deletion at the application layer, preserving audit integrity. The external_idp_id enables stateless authentication via JWT tokens without storing passwords.

### Migration 4: Documents Table
**Location:** `/Users/mattfili/Dev/hippa-compliant-railway-stack/backend/alembic/versions/20251016_1204_e2495309c71b_create_documents_table.py`

Created the documents table with pgvector support and S3 integration:
- Foreign keys to both tenants(id) and users(id) with ON DELETE RESTRICT
- embedding_vector column using VECTOR(1024) type for Titan Embeddings V2 compatibility
- JSONB metadata column with GIN index for flexible document attributes
- CHECK constraint on status IN ('processing', 'completed', 'failed')
- S3 storage fields: s3_key (VARCHAR(1024)), s3_bucket (VARCHAR(255)), filename (VARCHAR(512))
- Composite indexes: idx_documents_tenant_created, idx_documents_tenant_user, idx_documents_tenant_status (partial)
- GIN index idx_documents_metadata_gin for JSONB containment queries

**Rationale:** The VECTOR(1024) column supports semantic search without requiring a separate chunks table, simplifying the MVP. The vector column is nullable since embeddings are generated asynchronously after upload. The JSONB metadata field allows flexible custom attributes without schema migrations. The CHECK constraint on status prevents invalid state transitions at the database level. Composite indexes list tenant_id first for optimal partition pruning.

### Migration 5: Audit Logs Table
**Location:** `/Users/mattfili/Dev/hippa-compliant-railway-stack/backend/alembic/versions/20251016_1204_281e991e2aee_create_audit_logs_table.py`

Created the audit_logs table with database-enforced immutability:
- NO updated_at or deleted_at columns (append-only design)
- PL/pgSQL trigger function prevent_audit_log_modification() that raises exceptions
- BEFORE UPDATE and BEFORE DELETE triggers blocking all modification attempts
- INET type for ip_address column (native PostgreSQL IP address storage)
- Nullable user_id for system-initiated actions
- Composite indexes for audit queries: idx_audit_logs_tenant_created, idx_audit_logs_user_created (partial WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL), idx_audit_logs_action, idx_audit_logs_resource
- GIN index on metadata JSONB for flexible audit searches

**Rationale:** The trigger-based immutability ensures that even privileged database users cannot modify historical audit logs, meeting HIPAA compliance requirements. The append-only design simplifies the data model and improves write performance. Using INET for IP addresses provides native validation and storage optimization. The partial index on idx_audit_logs_user_created excludes NULL user_ids (system actions), improving query performance.

### Schema Impact
All four tables now exist in the database schema with proper relationships and constraints. The tenants table is the root of the multi-tenant hierarchy. Users and documents are scoped to tenants via foreign keys with ON DELETE RESTRICT, ensuring explicit handling of tenant deletion. Audit logs track all operations across all tables with immutability enforced at the database level.

The schema supports:
- Multi-tenant data isolation through foreign keys
- Soft deletes on tenants, users, and documents (NOT audit_logs)
- Email reuse after soft deletion via partial unique indexes
- Vector similarity search with 1024-dimensional embeddings
- Flexible metadata storage via JSONB
- Append-only audit logging with tamper-proof triggers
- Future per-tenant encryption (kms_key_arn column)
- Future RBAC implementation (role column)

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies Added
None. All migrations use standard PostgreSQL features and the pgvector extension enabled in Migration 1.

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
None created in this task. Testing will be performed in Phase 4 (RLS Integration Tests) and Phase 5 (Audit Log Immutability Tests).

### Test Coverage
Not applicable for this migration-only task. Migrations follow spec exactly and will be tested during Task Group 2.5 (Verify table migrations run successfully) when a database is available.

### Manual Testing Performed
Migrations were validated against the specification to ensure:
- All column names, types, and constraints match the spec
- All indexes match the spec (including partial index conditions)
- All foreign keys use ON DELETE RESTRICT
- All table and column comments are present
- System tenant seed data is included
- Trigger functions and triggers for audit log immutability are correct
- Downgrade functions properly clean up all created objects

The migrations will be executed against a test database in a later phase to verify:
- All 4 tables are created successfully
- System tenant seed data exists with correct UUID
- Foreign key constraints enforce referential integrity
- Audit log triggers prevent UPDATE/DELETE operations
- Migrations are fully reversible via downgrade()

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Backend Migrations Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/backend/migrations.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
All four migrations follow the "Reversible Migrations" standard with complete downgrade() functions that drop all created objects (tables, indexes, triggers, functions). Each migration is "Small and Focused" on a single table creation. "Separate Schema and Data" is followed with seed data only in Migration 2 for the essential system tenant. "Clear Naming Conventions" are used with descriptive migration messages and Alembic's auto-generated timestamped filenames. All migrations are ready for "Version Control" and will never be modified after deployment.

**Deviations:** None. All standards fully met.

### Global Coding Style Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Migrations use "Consistent Naming Conventions" with lowercase snake_case for all database objects (tables, columns, indexes, constraints). SQL is "Automated Formatting" with consistent indentation and line breaks. All objects have "Meaningful Names" that reveal intent (idx_users_tenant_email_active clearly indicates a unique index on tenant_id and email for active users). Migrations are "Small and Focused Functions" with clear separation of concerns. No "Dead Code" exists - all SQL statements are necessary and executed. "DRY Principle" is applied where appropriate without over-abstraction.

**Deviations:** None.

### Global Validation Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/validation.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Database-level validation is implemented via CHECK constraints (documents.status enum values) and NOT NULL constraints on required fields. Foreign key constraints provide referential integrity validation. Partial unique indexes enforce uniqueness rules while supporting soft deletes. The immutability triggers on audit_logs provide validation that prevents modification after creation.

**Deviations:** None.

## Integration Points

### Internal Dependencies
- Migration 1 (pgvector extension) must be applied before Migration 4 (documents table with VECTOR column)
- All migrations depend on SoftDeleteMixin pattern established in Task Group 1
- Migrations 3-5 depend on Migration 2 (tenants table) due to foreign key relationships

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None. All migrations created successfully and match the specification exactly.

### Limitations
1. **Database Verification Deferred**
   - Description: Migrations have not been executed against an actual database yet
   - Reason: No database connection configured in development environment
   - Future Consideration: Task 2.5 verification will be performed when database is available

2. **HNSW Vector Index Not Included**
   - Description: Vector similarity search index not created in these migrations
   - Reason: HNSW index is deferred to Migration 6 (Task Group 3) per spec design
   - Future Consideration: Migration 6 will add the HNSW index on documents.embedding_vector

3. **Row-Level Security Not Enabled**
   - Description: RLS policies not created in these migrations
   - Reason: RLS policies are deferred to Migration 7 (Task Group 3) per spec design
   - Future Consideration: Migration 7 will enable RLS and create isolation policies

## Performance Considerations
All composite indexes list tenant_id first to enable partition pruning in multi-tenant queries. Partial indexes with WHERE deleted_at IS NULL reduce index size and improve query performance for active records. GIN indexes on JSONB columns enable fast containment queries without full table scans. The VECTOR column is nullable to avoid blocking document creation while embeddings generate asynchronously.

The audit_logs table uses an append-only design which optimizes write performance by avoiding UPDATE operations. The triggers are lightweight (single RAISE EXCEPTION statement) and will not impact INSERT performance.

## Security Considerations
All foreign keys use ON DELETE RESTRICT to prevent cascading deletes that could bypass audit trails or soft delete tracking. The audit_logs table has database-level immutability enforcement via triggers, ensuring even superusers cannot tamper with historical records. The system tenant UUID is a well-known constant ('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000') rather than a randomly generated value, ensuring consistency across environments.

TIMESTAMPTZ columns throughout ensure timezone-aware timestamps for HIPAA compliance. The partial unique index on users.email prevents duplicate active emails within a tenant while allowing email reuse after soft deletion. The CHECK constraint on documents.status prevents invalid state transitions at the database level.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
- Task Group 3 (Migrations 6-7) depends on these table migrations for creating HNSW indexes and RLS policies
- Task Group 4 (SQLAlchemy Models) depends on these table schemas for model definitions
- Task Group 5 (RLS Testing) depends on Migration 7 RLS policies which depend on these tables
- Task Group 6 (Audit Log Testing) depends on Migration 5 audit_logs table and triggers

## Notes
All migrations follow the existing pattern established in Migration 1 (pgvector extension) using op.execute() with raw SQL rather than Alembic's declarative operations. This approach provides full control over SQL syntax and ensures compatibility with PostgreSQL-specific features (VECTOR type, INET type, TIMESTAMPTZ, partial indexes, triggers).

The migrations are ordered to respect foreign key dependencies: tenants → users → documents → audit_logs. Each migration is fully reversible via DROP TABLE CASCADE in downgrade(), ensuring safe rollback if needed.

The system tenant seed data is critical for administrative operations and will be referenced throughout the application with the constant SYSTEM_TENANT_ID = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'.
