# Task 7: Railway Integration & Template Metadata

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #7 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-16-database-schema-multi-tenant/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** database-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** âœ… Complete

### Task Description
Implement Railway integration components including template.json for one-click deployment, pgvector extension verification, PostgreSQL performance tuning documentation, and comprehensive Railway deployment instructions in the README.

## Implementation Summary

This task group establishes the infrastructure for one-click Railway deployment of the HIPAA-compliant multi-tenant RAG application. The implementation provides three key components:

1. **Template Metadata (`template.json`)**: Defines the Railway deployment template with PostgreSQL (pgvector-enabled) and backend services, including all required environment variables and HIPAA compliance instructions.

2. **pgvector Verification**: Enhanced the existing pgvector migration to verify extension availability at migration time, with comprehensive setup and troubleshooting documentation.

3. **Production Documentation**: Created detailed guides for PostgreSQL performance tuning (POSTGRESQL_TUNING.md) and Railway-specific setup procedures (RAILWAY_SETUP.md), covering HIPAA compliance requirements, performance optimization, and backup configuration.

4. **README Enhancement**: Updated the main README with a complete Railway deployment section, including step-by-step instructions, environment variable documentation, and HIPAA compliance checklist.

The implementation enables developers to deploy the application to Railway with minimal manual configuration while maintaining HIPAA compliance standards and production-ready performance settings.

## Key Implementation Details

### template.json - Railway Template Metadata
**Location:** `template.json`

Created Railway template metadata file defining the complete deployment configuration:

**Services:**
- PostgreSQL service using `pgvector/pgvector:pg15` Docker image
- Backend service with health check endpoint `/api/v1/health/ready`

**Environment Variables:** 8 required variables documented with descriptions
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (auto-generated)
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (CORS configuration)
- `OIDC_ISSUER_URL`, `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` (authentication)
- `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (Bedrock/KMS access)

**Instructions:** Comprehensive deployment guide covering:
- Prerequisites (AWS account, OIDC provider, Railway BAA)
- Setup steps (deploy template, configure variables, verify deployment)
- HIPAA compliance notes (BAA requirements, encryption, backups)

**Rationale:** Provides one-click deployment capability while ensuring all necessary configurations are documented upfront. The template enforces best practices by requiring critical environment variables and providing clear HIPAA compliance guidance.

### pgvector Extension Verification
**Location:** `backend/alembic/versions/20251015_1506_1ef269d5fac7_enable_pgvector_extension.py`

Enhanced the pgvector migration with verification logic:

```python
# Verify extension is available
connection = op.get_bind()
result = connection.execute(
    text("SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions WHERE name = 'vector'")
).fetchone()

if not result:
    raise Exception(
        "pgvector extension not available in this PostgreSQL installation. "
        "Please ensure Railway PostgreSQL uses pgvector/pgvector:pg15 image. "
        "Deploy using Railway pgvector template: https://railway.com/deploy/3jJFCA"
    )
```

**Rationale:** Fail-fast approach catches pgvector availability issues during migration rather than at runtime when vector operations are attempted. Clear error message guides users to the correct Railway template.

### Railway Setup Documentation
**Location:** `backend/docs/RAILWAY_SETUP.md`

Comprehensive 500+ line guide covering:

**PostgreSQL Deployment:**
- Two deployment options (pgvector template recommended, manual setup alternative)
- Step-by-step provisioning instructions
- Connection details and Railway auto-injection

**pgvector Verification:**
- Automatic verification via migration
- Manual verification steps with SQL queries
- Test vector operations

**Troubleshooting:**
- Extension not available (solution: use correct Docker image)
- Permission errors (Railway postgres user has superuser)
- Vector query issues (index verification, dimension checks)
- Migration timeouts (concurrent index creation, plan upgrades)

**Security Best Practices:**
- Encryption at rest configuration
- Network access restrictions (private by default)
- Password management (auto-generated strong passwords)
- Audit logging configuration

**Backup and Recovery:**
- Enable Railway Backups feature
- 30+ day retention (HIPAA requirement)
- Test restoration procedures

**HIPAA Compliance Checklist:**
- 9-point checklist covering BAA, encryption, backups, audit logging, RLS policies

**Rationale:** Provides complete Railway-specific guidance in one place. Troubleshooting section addresses common issues proactively, reducing deployment friction.

### PostgreSQL Tuning Documentation
**Location:** `backend/docs/POSTGRESQL_TUNING.md`

Extensive 600+ line tuning guide with configuration templates:

**Production Performance Optimization:**
- Memory configuration for 4GB, 8GB, 16GB RAM tiers
- Memory tuning guidelines (shared_buffers, effective_cache_size, work_mem)
- Connection configuration (max_connections, timeouts)
- Query performance settings (parallel workers, JIT compilation)
- Write performance optimization (WAL buffers, checkpoints)

**HIPAA Compliance Settings:**
- WAL archiving for audit trail (`wal_level = 'replica'`)
- Comprehensive audit logging (`log_statement = 'all'`)
- TLS/SSL encryption enforcement
- Connection logging for access tracking

**Vector Search Optimization:**
- HNSW index parameter tuning (m, ef_construction)
- Query-time search quality settings (ef_search)
- Shared memory allocation for vector operations

**Monitoring and Maintenance:**
- pg_stat_statements extension for query tracking
- Index usage monitoring queries
- Table size monitoring
- Autovacuum configuration

**Complete Production Script:**
- Single SQL script applying all recommended settings for 8GB production instance
- Ready to execute via Railway PostgreSQL console

**Rationale:** Provides production-ready configuration without requiring deep PostgreSQL expertise. Settings are organized by purpose (performance, compliance, vector search) and include explanations. Complete script allows quick setup while individual sections enable understanding and customization.

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Limitations

1. **Railway Template Marketplace Publishing**
   - Description: template.json is created but requires Railway team approval for template marketplace listing
   - Reason: Railway templates must be reviewed before public availability
   - Future Consideration: Submit template for review once application is production-ready

2. **PostgreSQL Tuning Requires Restart**
   - Description: Most ALTER SYSTEM commands require PostgreSQL restart to take effect
   - Reason: PostgreSQL architecture limitation
   - Workaround: Documented restart requirement clearly in POSTGRESQL_TUNING.md with step-by-step instructions

3. **No Automated PostgreSQL Tuning**
   - Description: PostgreSQL tuning must be applied manually via Railway console
   - Reason: Railway doesn't support automated PostgreSQL configuration via template.json
   - Future Consideration: Create initialization script if Railway adds support for custom PostgreSQL initialization

## Performance Considerations

### PostgreSQL Tuning Impact
- **Memory Settings:** Proper shared_buffers and effective_cache_size configuration can improve query performance by 2-5x
- **HNSW Index:** Default parameters (m=16, ef_construction=64) provide good balance of recall and performance; documented customization for specific workload needs
- **Connection Pooling:** Application pool size (20) fits within Railway Free/Hobby tier limits, documented scaling guidance for production loads

### Documentation Performance
- **RAILWAY_SETUP.md:** 500+ lines covering all deployment scenarios prevents repeated support questions
- **POSTGRESQL_TUNING.md:** 600+ lines with complete production script enables quick setup while detailed sections enable optimization

## Security Considerations

### HIPAA Compliance
- **BAA Requirement:** Documented prominently in template instructions and HIPAA compliance checklist
- **Encryption:** Clear guidance on enabling encryption at rest in Railway settings
- **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive audit logging configuration documented with log_statement = 'all'
- **Backup Retention:** 30+ day backup retention requirement clearly stated

### Environment Variables
- **Sensitive Variables:** Marked as sensitive in template.json (OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET, AWS credentials)
- **Auto-Generation:** POSTGRES_PASSWORD uses ${RANDOM_PASSWORD} placeholder for strong password generation
- **No Secrets:** template.json contains no hardcoded secrets, all values are placeholders or user-provided

### Network Security
- **Private Networking:** Documented that Railway PostgreSQL is private by default
- **TLS Enforcement:** Documented ssl configuration in POSTGRESQL_TUNING.md
- **Access Logging:** Connection logging enabled for access auditing

## Dependencies for Other Tasks

This task group has no dependencies for other tasks in this feature. It completes the Railway integration work for Feature 2.

However, it enables:
- **Future Feature 3 (AWS Infrastructure):** template.json documents AWS environment variables needed for Bedrock/KMS
- **Future Feature 5 (Document Ingestion):** Railway deployment provides production environment for document upload API
- **Future Feature 10 (Audit Logging):** PostgreSQL tuning guide optimizes audit_logs table performance

## Notes

### Railway Template URL
Throughout the documentation, we reference https://railway.com/deploy/3jJFCA as the pgvector template URL. This URL points to Railway's official pgvector PostgreSQL template. If Railway changes this URL, documentation will need updating.

### PostgreSQL Version
Template uses `pgvector/pgvector:pg15` (PostgreSQL 15). This is the latest stable version with pgvector support as of implementation. Future updates should consider PostgreSQL 16+ when Railway templates are available.

### Complete Production Script Location
The complete production PostgreSQL tuning script is at the end of POSTGRESQL_TUNING.md (lines 680-750). This script can be copied directly into Railway PostgreSQL console for quick production setup.

### Documentation Maintenance
Both RAILWAY_SETUP.md and POSTGRESQL_TUNING.md include version-specific information (Railway plan tiers, PostgreSQL version, etc.). These should be reviewed quarterly for accuracy as Railway evolves their platform.

### HIPAA Compliance Verification
The HIPAA compliance checklist appears in three locations:
1. template.json instructions
2. RAILWAY_SETUP.md (complete 9-point checklist)
3. backend/README.md (condensed version with links)

This redundancy ensures compliance requirements are visible at every deployment touchpoint.
