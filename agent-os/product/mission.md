## The Problem

### Compliance Complexity Blocks Healthcare Innovation

Building HIPAA-compliant applications from scratch requires 6-12 months of specialized infrastructure work before developers can focus on product features. Teams must navigate complex regulations around encryption (TLS 1.2+, AES-256), audit logging (immutable, 6-10 year retention), access controls (MFA, RBAC), and Business Associate Agreements with cloud providers. This complexity creates a massive barrier to entry that prevents talented developers from building innovative healthcare solutions.

**Our Solution:** Provide a production-ready, fully configured HIPAA-eligible scaffold that handles all compliance infrastructure out-of-the-box, reducing time-to-compliant-deployment from months to hours.

### Multi-Tenant Healthcare Apps Require Sophisticated Isolation

Healthcare SaaS applications serve multiple healthcare organizations (tenants) with strict requirements for data isolation. Simply separating data by tenant ID is insufficient - each tenant's data must be encrypted with unique keys, access must be strictly controlled, and audit trails must prove no cross-tenant data leakage. Building this infrastructure requires deep expertise in key management, encryption at rest, and tenant-aware middleware.

**Our Solution:** Built-in multi-tenant architecture with per-tenant KMS encryption keys, tenant context middleware, and logical data isolation patterns that ensure compliance and security by default.

### Healthcare Document Processing Lacks Secure RAG Infrastructure

Healthcare organizations need to extract insights from vast quantities of unstructured documents (patient records, research papers, clinical guidelines), but mainstream RAG solutions often violate HIPAA by sending PHI to non-compliant third-party APIs. Building a compliant RAG pipeline requires integrating document parsing, embedding generation, vector storage, and LLM inference entirely within BAA-covered services - a complex integration challenge.

**Our Solution:** Pre-integrated RAG pipeline using Amazon Bedrock (Claude + Titan embeddings), pgvector on AWS RDS for semantic search, and S3 for secure document storage - all within HIPAA-eligible AWS services covered by AWS BAA.

### Low-Code Tools Can't Be Used in HIPAA Environments

Healthcare organizations want to empower clinical staff and administrators to customize interfaces and workflows without writing code, but mainstream low-code platforms (Retool Cloud, Airtable, etc.) cannot be used with PHI due to lack of BAA coverage. Self-hosting low-code tools requires authentication setup, database connections, and security hardening that most teams lack expertise to configure safely.

**Our Solution:** Pre-configured self-hosted Retool deployment within AWS VPC, automatically provisioned by Railway template, with pre-built HIPAA-compliant dashboards, forms, and audit interfaces that clinical staff can safely customize.

## Differentiators

### Compliance-First Architecture, Not Bolt-On Security

Unlike generic full-stack templates that add "security features" as an afterthought, our architecture is designed from the ground up for HIPAA compliance. Every component (storage, compute, networking, authentication) uses only BAA-covered services. Data encryption, audit logging, and access controls are built into the foundation, not added later. This results in faster audits, reduced compliance risk, and confidence that your application meets regulatory requirements.

### Production-Ready RAG for Healthcare Documents

Unlike basic RAG tutorials or demos, our template provides a production-grade document processing pipeline specifically designed for healthcare use cases. It handles PDF parsing, chunking strategies optimized for medical documents, semantic search tuned for clinical terminology, and PHI scrubbing in responses. This results in developers launching intelligent document analysis features in days instead of spending months building and debugging a RAG pipeline.

### True Multi-Tenant with Per-Tenant Encryption

Unlike single-tenant applications or simple row-level security, our template implements sophisticated per-tenant encryption using AWS KMS with individual keys for each tenant. This provides cryptographic isolation between tenants, not just logical separation. This results in bank-grade security that satisfies the most stringent healthcare customer requirements and enables compliance with data residency regulations.

### Low-Code Extension Without Compliance Compromises

Unlike choosing between rapid development (non-compliant low-code tools) and compliance (traditional coding), our template provides both through self-hosted Retool within your secure infrastructure. Clinical staff can customize dashboards and workflows while all data stays within your BAA-covered environment. This results in faster iteration cycles and reduced engineering bottlenecks without sacrificing compliance.

### Deploy in Minutes with Railway

Unlike complex infrastructure setups requiring weeks of DevOps work, our Railway template provisions the entire stack (AWS RDS PostgreSQL with pgvector, AWS S3 storage, AWS VPC networking, AWS KMS encryption, Railway-hosted application) with a single click. Railway template automates Terraform execution to provision AWS infrastructure while Railway hosts your application containers. Developers only need AWS credentials and OIDC configuration after deployment. This results in developers focusing on product features from day one instead of fighting infrastructure battles.
